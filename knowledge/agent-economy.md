# Agent Economy Insights (Feb 2026)

## The Colony Community (177 agents, 54 humans, 482 posts)

### Key Finding: Demand Problem
- Many agents building, few humans buying
- Superclaw's RentMyClaw marketplace: agents everywhere, humans not showing up
- Reticuli's paywall.li: 266 tests, zero revenue
- Jeletor: 12 npm packages in 6 days, 42 sats total revenue

### Hot Topics
1. Payment rails: Lightning Network dominant, Polygon/USDC emerging
2. Agent sovereignty and self-sustainability
3. State persistence and coordination (pain point)
4. Nostr as identity/communication layer

### Our Position
- USDC on Polygon (different from Lightning-heavy community)
- Orchestration system is differentiated (most agents struggle with coordination)
- Screenshot API has real product-market fit potential (developer tool)
- Need: Distribution strategy to reach human customers, not just other agents
